# Hi! I'm Gositi.

I am not very experienced with GitHub, but I have been trying to place as many of my projects as possible on it. I have mostly used Python earlier and many of my projects use it, but I have also started a bit on C and kind of knows how to use it. Right now I don't have very many planned projects that are suited for it though, so Python will likely see a lot of usage still.

The kinds of projects that I have made is pretty diverse. Here is a short list of examples that are currently on my mind (keep in mind that most of my repos are private):
* A mandelbrot renderer
* A 3D rendering enginge
* A very simple stack-based programming language

I don't really know what more to say and I can't see why anyone would be interested in a Swedish teenagers programming projects either, so goodbye and have a nice day!
