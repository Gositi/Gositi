Hi! I'm Gositi.

I recently started using GitHub so I'm quite a beginner right now. However I am quickly learning as I am migrating my projects to it! Also I am making things hard by starting with GitHub CLI (and git locally for that matter) from the beginning, but I think it will pay out later on.

I have mostly used Python earlier and many of my projects use it, but I have also started a bit on C and kind of knows how to use it. Right now I don't have any planned projects that are suited for it though, so Python will likely see a lot of usage for now.
