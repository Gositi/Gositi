# Hi! I'm Gositi.

Welcome to my GitHub. I usually program in Python or C, and I have been trying to move over to C as much as possible.
Some of my projects combine them both, with the C program doing the most work while using Python for simpler scripting tasks (loading configs in a way that the C program easily can digest, for example).
Most of my repos are private, because I don't want to show my ugly code. 
Really the only reason my mandelbrot renderer is public is because someone requested to see it.
Perhaps I should make more of them public?
First I gotta fill in the README of my mandelbrot renderer though...

The kinds of projects that I have made is pretty diverse.
Here is a short list of examples that are currently on my mind (keep in mind that most of my repos are private):
- Discord-fs, allowing you to use Discord as "cloud storage"
- A mandelbrot renderer
- A basic 3D rendering enginge
- A very simple stack-based programming language
